        ### Overview

        The Mondoo Slack Security policy ensure best-practice settings for Slack.

        ### Prerequisites

        To run this query pack, you will need access to the Slack API. To get a token, you need to create an App for the Slack workspace 
        and assign the appropriate permissions:

        1. Sign in to [the Slack website](https://api.slack.com/apps/), and view "Your Apps"
        2. Click "Create New App"
        3. Select "From scratch"
        4. Enter an "App Name" e.g. cnquery and select the workspace, then click "Create App"
        5. In the section "Add features & functionality" click on "Permissions"
        6. Scroll to "Scopes" and then "User Token Scopes"
 
        Note: Bots are very limited in their access; therefore we need to set the user scopes

        7. Add the required permissions to "User Token Scopes"

        | OAuth Scope  |
        | ---- | 
        | [channels:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/channels:read) | 
        | [groups:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/groups:read) |
        | [im:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/im:read) |
        | [mpim:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/mpim:read) | 
        | [team:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/team:read) | 
        | [usergroups:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/usergroups:read) | 
        | [users:read](https://api.slack.com/scopes/users:read) |

        8. Scroll up to "OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace" and click "Install to Workspace"
        9. Copy the provided "User OAuth Token", it will look like `xoxp-1234567890123-1234567890123-1234567890123-12345cea5ae0d3bed30dca43cb34c2d1`
