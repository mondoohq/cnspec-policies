        ## Overview

        OpenSSL Vulnerability Policy by Mondoo checks for vulnerable OpenSSL installation on Unix/ Linux system.

        ## Remote scan

        Remote scans use native providers in `cnspec` to provide on demand scan results without the need to install any agents, or integration.

        For a complete list of native providers run:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ```

        ### Scan a machine via ssh

        Open a terminal and cnspec scan:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan ssh vagrant@192.168.56.244 -i <ssh-key-file> -f mondoo-unix-openssl-vulnerability.mql.yaml
        ```

        ### Scan a container

        ```bash
        cnspec scan container ubuntu:22.04 -f mondoo-unix-openssl-vulnerability.mql.yaml
        ```

    title: Ensure vulnerable OpenSSL version 3.0.0 - 3.0.6 are not installed

        The OpenSSL Project released a security fix (OpenSSL version 3.0.7) for a new-and-disclosed CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 on Tuesday, November 1, 2022. This CVE is categorized as "HIGH" and affects OpenSSL versions from 3.0.0 to 3.0.6.

        OpenSSL [Issue severity](https://www.openssl.org/policies/general/security-policy.html):

        This includes issues that are of a lower risk than critical, perhaps due to affecting less common configurations, or which are less likely to be exploitable. These issues will be kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported versions. We will attempt to keep the time these issues are private to a minimum; our aim would be no longer than a month where this is something under our control.

        OpenSSL is the most popular open source cryptography and SSL/TLS toolkit. It's used by most HTTPS websites and is the crucial mechanism to encrypt connections to servers. Since OpenSSL is so fundamental to our infrastructure, such a critical vulnerability represents a severe threat to a wide range of businesses and individuals.

        ## Update via shell

        Run the following command to update the openssl version:

        ### Debian / Ubuntu

        ```bash
        apt update && apt --only-upgrade install -y libssl3
        ```

        ### RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux and derivatives

        ```bash
        dnf update openssl-libs
        ```

        ## Update via Ansible

        ### Debian / Ubuntu

        ```yaml
        - hosts: <define hosts>
          tasks:
            - name: Update openssl package for Debian based OS
              ansible.builtin.apt:
                name: libssl3
                state: latest
                update_cache: yes
            only_upgrade: yes
              become: yes
        ```

        ### RHEL/Fedora/Amazon Linux and derivatives

        ```yaml
        - hosts: <define hosts>
          tasks:
            - name: Update openssl package for Red Hat based OS
              ansible.builtin.dnf:
                name: openssl-libs
                state: latest
                update_only: yes
              become: yes
