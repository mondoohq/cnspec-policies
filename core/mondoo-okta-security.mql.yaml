        # Overview

        The Mondoo Okta Security policy bundle provides security recommendations for Okta organizations.

        ## About remote scanning

        Remote scans with cnspec provide on demand security assessments of infrastructure and services without the need to install any agents or integrations. cnspec comes with a growing list of providers to connect and scan local and remote targets. 

        A complete list of providers can be found by running the following command: 
        
        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ``` 

        ### cnspec Okta provider
        
        This policy uses the `okta` provider to authenticate with Okta's API in order to remotely scan an Okta organization. Additional information on the `okta` provider can be found by running the following command: 
        
        ```bash
        cnspec scan okta --help
        ```
      
        ## Configuring the Okta provider

        The `okta` provider for cnspec requires an API token to authenticate and run scans. 

        ### Create an API token

        To create an API token, see [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/create-an-api-token/main/) on Okta's documentation site.
        
        ### Configure a OKTA_TOKEN environment variable

        You supply your API token to cnspec using the `OKTA_TOKEN` environment variable. 

        #### Linux / macOS

        ```bash
        export OKTA_TOKEN=<OKTA_TOKEN>
        ```

        #### Windows 

        ```powershell
        $Env:OKTA_TOKEN = "<OKTA_TOKEN>"
        ```        

        ## Scan an Okta organization
        
        To scan the configuration of an Okta organization all together:  

        ```bash
        cnspec scan okta --organization DOMAIN.okta.com --token $OKTA_TOKEN  --policy-bundle mondoo-okta-security.mql.yaml
        ```

    title: Ensure a limited session lifetime has been enforced
    severity: 80
    docs:
      desc: |
        Session lifetime determines the maximum idle time of an end user's sign-on session to Okta. By enforcing a limited session lifetime for users, admins reduce the window of time wherein a malicious third party could attempt to access a user's applications from an active session.
        
        This is especially important considering the workforce is no longer  strictly confined to within the walls of an office. This functionality is a must for any organization with employees, contractors, and partners that work from home or other remote locations like coffee shops and  airports.

        The maximum session lifetime ensures that a session will expire after this maximum session time even if idle time never expires. Setting an upper bound minimizes the risk of session cookies misuse or hijacking.
        User session will expire when the user has been inactive on Okta for the set time period, regardless of Max Okta session lifetime.

    title: Ensure OpenID or SAML authentication are used for app access
    severity: 80
    docs:
      desc: |
        Okta supports two protocols for handling federated SSO. OpenID Connect (OIDC) and Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML). The SSO protocol that you choose to implement your integration with is based on your app and use case. For new integrations, OIDC is recommended.

        OpenID Connect is widely used not only in organizations but also in everyday scenarios like “Log in with Google”. The OAuth flow is quite different from the SAML flow. The main difference is that some actions happen in the user’s browser which is called the front channel and some actions directly between the Client Application and the Identity Provider (the backchannel).
        This reduces the attack surface substantially as the most important requests are sent through the backchannel.

        SAML, in the most basic (and the most popular) setup, allows you to pass information about a user between an Identity Provider and a Service Provider (Client Application) via the user’s browser (User Agent). It does not require a direct connection between the Identity Provider and the Service Provider – everything happens via browser redirects. The user requests a signed document that confirms their identity from the Identity Provider, gets authenticated, and then sends the signed document to the Service Provider in order to log in. The signed document can also include information about the user’s privileges, groups, etc.

    title: Ensure Secure Web Authentication (SWA) is disabled for critical apps
    severity: 60
    docs:
      desc: |
        Secure Web Authentication (SWA) is an Okta technology that provides Single Sign-On (SSO) functionality to external web applications that don't support federated protocols.

        Administrators can set the credentials for the application, or the end user can enter a specific username and password. Okta keeps the credentials for that  application inside a secure store, encrypted with strong AES-256  encryption. After setting the credentials, end users only need to  authenticate with Okta, and then they can SSO directly into the  application. 

        In a simple terms, SWA is basically a password safe which acts like a password manager, by saving the password in the application directly and okta knows what that password is. 

        It is always recommended to use OpenID or when not possible SAML for critical applications.

    title: Ensure the Password/IdP plus Another factor chosen for MFA
    severity: 100
    docs:
      desc: |
        A key goal for MFA is to add additional authentication factors to increase security.
        There are three common types of authentication factors used to authenticate users:
          * Knowledge -  Something you know, such as a password.
          * Possession - Something you have, such as a security key or Authenticator App
          * Inherence -  Something you are, such as a unique biometric or behavioral characteristic

        Among the options that Okta currently offers in MFA configuration part, the combination of Password/IdP plus Another factor is the best practice.

    title: Ensure the re-authentication period for Password/IdP and MFA code is active and short
    severity: 60
    docs:
      desc: |
        The best practice is To prompt the user to re-enter the password and MFA code periodically. Like most topics in information security, the re-authentication interval has a tradeoff between security and convenience: a short amount has better security but is inconvenient, while a longer amount is more convenient but has lower security.

        It should be tested that following two options never being configured for password and other factors: 
          * Every sign-in attempt
          * Never re-authenticate if the session is active 

          Our recommendations is to configure the Password re-authentication after 4 hours and other factor every 8 hours.
