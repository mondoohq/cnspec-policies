        ## Overview

        The HTTP Security by Mondoo policy includes checks for ensuring the security of HTTP headers.

        ## Remote scan

        Remote scans use cnspec providers to retrieve on-demand scan results without having to install any agents.

        For a complete list of providers run:

        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ```

        ### Scan a host

        ```bash
        cnspec scan host <fqdn>
        ```
