        ## Overview

        The GitLab Security by Mondoo policy bundle provides guidance for establishing minimum recommended security and operational best practices for GitLab. This policy is early access.

        ## Remote scan

        Remote scans use native transports in `cnspec` to provide on demand scan results without the need to install any agents, or integration. 
        
        For a complete list of native transports run: 
        
        ```bash
        cnspec scan --help
        ``` 

        ### Prerequisites

        Remote scans of GitLab requires a [personal access token](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html) with access to the group.

        ### Run a scan of a GitLab group

        Open a terminal and configure an environment variable with your GitLab personal access token:

        ```bash
        export GITLAB_TOKEN=<your personal access token> 
        ```

        Run a remote scan of your GitLab group: 

        ```bash
        cnspec scan gitlab --group <group_name>
        ```

        GitLab allows users with the Owner role to set a project's or group's visibility as:

        - Public
        - Internal
        - Private

        These visibility levels affect who can see the project in the public access directory (/public for your GitLab instance). For example, https://gitlab.com/public. You can control the visibility of individual features with project feature settings.

        Private projects can only be cloned and viewed by project members (except for guests). They appear in the public access directory (`/public``) for project members only.

        __cnspec Shell__

        1. Open a Terminal.
        2. Connect cnspec shell to GitLab `cnspec shell gitlab --option token=${GITLAB_TOKEN} --option group=<group name>`
        3. Run the following query

           ```mql
           gitlab.group.visibility 
           ```

        To make the visibility of a GitLab group private, see [Change group visibility](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/public_access.html#change-group-visibility).

    title: Ensure two-factor authentication is required
    docs: 
      desc: |
        Two-factor authentication (2FA) provides an additional layer of security to your users' GitLab accounts. When enabled, users are prompted for a code generated by an application in addition to supplying their username and password to sign in.

        __cnspec Shell__

        1. Open a Terminal.
        2. Connect cnspec shell to GitLab `cnspec shell gitlab --option token=${GITLAB_TOKEN} --option group=<group name>`
        3. Run the following query

           ```mql
           gitlab.group.requireTwoFactorAuthentication 
           ```
      remediation: |
        GitLab offers several options to configure 2FA for your users. To enable MFA in your GitLab, see [Enforce two-factor authentication](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/security/two_factor_authentication.html) on the GitLab documentation site.
