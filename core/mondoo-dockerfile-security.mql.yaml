          ## Overview

            The Docker Container Security policy by Mondoo provides guidance for establishing secure Docker container configurations and deployments.

            If you have questions, comments, or have identified ways to improve this policy, please write us at hello@mondoo.com, or reach out in GitHub Discussions.

          ## Remote scan

          Remote scans use cnspec providers to retrieve on-demand scan results without having to install any agents.

          For a complete list of providers run:

          ```bash
          cnspec scan --help
          ```

          ## Prerequisites

          Remote scans of Docker containers require Docker CLI access to the host where the containers are running.

          Scan a Docker environment

          Open a terminal and configure Docker CLI access to your Docker environment:

          ```bash
          docker login
          ```

          Run a scan of the Docker environment:

          ```bash
          cnspec scan docker
          ```

    docs:
      desc: |
        Management ports such as SSH (port 22), Docker Remote API (port 2375), Consul (port 8500), and Kubernetes API (port 6443) are commonly targeted by attackers. Exposing these ports in Docker containers increases the risk of unauthorized access and security vulnerabilities. This test ensures that these management ports are not exposed in Docker container configurations.
      remediation: |
        Review and update your Dockerfile to ensure that management ports (22 for SSH, 2375 for Docker Remote API, 8500 for Consul HTTP API, 6443 for Kubernetes API) are not exposed. 
        - Remove or restrict the exposure of these ports using the `EXPOSE` instruction in your Dockerfile.
        - Use Docker's port mapping options (`-p` or `--publish`) cautiously to avoid exposing these ports.
        - Ensure that any required management access is secured and appropriately managed.

          Ensure that certificate validation is not disabled in YUM or DNF package managers within Docker containers.

    docs:
      desc: |
          Ensure that containers are not run as the root user.
