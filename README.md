This project contains security and operational best-practice policies (as code) for use with [`cnspec`](https://github.com/mondoohq/cnspec). We've organized them into these directories:

- [core](core) - Core policies contain baseline security and operational best-practice controls for various scan targets. Core policies are maintained by Mondoo and have strict quality requirements.
- [extra](extra) - Extra policies are a mix of community- and Mondoo-maintained policy bundles that are outside Mondoo's core support tier.
- [community](community) - Community policies are primarily maintained by the community with the support of the Mondoo team. Community policies may move to extra or core over time.
