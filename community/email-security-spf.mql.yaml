        A TXT record is a type of resource record in the Domain Name System (DNS) used to provide the ability to associate arbitrary text with a host or other name, such as human readable information about a server, network, data center, or other accounting information.
      audit: Run the `dig -t TXT <domain>` command and verify that the SPF record is set
      remediation: |
        Add a TXT record to your DNS zone file.

    docs:
      desc: |
        A domains apex anchor record should be set to something, even if it's a redirect.
      audit: Run the `dig -t A <domain>` command and verify that there is an A record

        SPF (Sender Policy Framework) is a method of preventing email spoofing by allowing the owner of a domain to publish a list of mail servers that are authorized to send email from that domain.
      audit: Run the `dig -t TXT <domain>` command and verify that the SPF record is set
      remediation: |
        Add a TXT record to your DNS zone file with the following format:
        ```
        <domain> IN TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
        ```
